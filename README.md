# People Aware Labels

© Victor Loux & Alan Layt, sometime circa 2013.

> This project is the outcome of Prototyping Digital Futures, a module on the Digital Interaction Design course at DJCAD focused on reinventing and redefining social experiences using cutting-edge technology, based on a study of needs gathered through ethnography. The brief set to imagine what the McManus Galleries could look like in 2023, if all the surfaces (walls, floors and ceilings) were screens.

This is a Processing 2 prototype for “responsive” museum labels; the size of the text and the actual content change based on the distance of the user, the number of people watching an artifact at the same time, and interactivity would allow for alternative labels to be shown in certain contexts (i.e. simplified versions for children, always bigger for short-sighted people etc).

The code is provided as is, it was only one of the prototypes we made but it was not a deliverable so it's poorly commented. You'll need Processing 2.x (not 3) and OpenCV.
